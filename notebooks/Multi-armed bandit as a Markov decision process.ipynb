    "\n",
    "$\\alpha_i$ is the number of successes encountered so far when pulling arm $i$. $\\beta_i$ is, similarly, the number of failures encountered when pulling that arm. $r_t$ is the reward, either 0 or 1, from the last trial. \n",

    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we can use this optimal solution to compare it with commonly used heuristics like $\\epsilon$-greedy and UCB and determine how often these pick the optimal moves. Then we'll get some intuitions about what $\\epsilon$-greedy and UCB get right and wrong. Let's do it! "
